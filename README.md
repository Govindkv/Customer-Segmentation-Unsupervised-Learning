# Customer-Segmentation-Unsupervised-Learning
This include an EDA and Machine Learning Modeling file for Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering Algorithm
Custom Segmentation Project
Project Overview
The Custom Segmentation project aims to segment a given dataset based on user-defined criteria using machine learning and data analysis techniques. This segmentation helps in categorizing the data into meaningful groups for better analysis, targeting, and decision-making.

This project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, applying clustering algorithms, and evaluating the results. The objective is to implement a flexible and customizable segmentation framework that can be used across different domains such as customer segmentation, market analysis, and more.

Key Features
Customizable Segmentation: Allows users to define custom criteria for segmentation.
Visualization: Provides graphical representations of the segmentation results.
